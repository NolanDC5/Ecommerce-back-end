## Description
I took a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The app displays the creation of mySQL database with models and associations. API Routes performs RESTful CRUD operations 

## Installation 
The user should clone the repository from GitHub. </br>
This application requires Node.js, Express.js, and Sequelize.</br> 
To connect to the database: 
- run ` mysql -u root -p ` and enter password from .env file. 
- Then source the schema.sql. 
- To seed the file run `npm run seed`. 
- Finally to connect to the server run `npm start`.
